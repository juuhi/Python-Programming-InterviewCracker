Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

def MissingNumber(self, array):
        n = len(array)
        total = (n)*(n+1)//2
        suma = sum(array)
        val = total - suma
        return val
     
#  If n is not given in argument of function 

def getMissingNo(A):
    n = len(A)
    total = (n + 1)*(n + 2)/2
    sum_of_A = sum(A)
    return total - sum_of_A
